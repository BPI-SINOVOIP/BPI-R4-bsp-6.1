Project Maintenance Processes
=============================

Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A) project follows the generic `trustedfirmware.org
Project Maintenance Process`_. The present document complements it by defining
TF-A project-specific decisions.

How to become a maintainer?

Election Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To put an individual's name up for election,

#. Send an email to all existing TF-A maintainers, asking whether they have any
   objections to this individual becoming a TF-A maintainer.

#. Give existing maintainers one calendar week to participate in the discussion.

#. If there are objections, the existing maintainers should try to resolve them
   amongst themselves. If they cannot, this should be escalated to the
   trustedfirmware.org Technical Steering Commitee (TSC).

#. If there are no (more) objections, announce the news on the TF-A mailing list
   and update the list of maintainers on the :ref:`Project
   Maintenance<maintainers>` page.
