	  Include support for 10GE SerDes which can be found on MT7988.
	  If this kernel should run on SoCs with 10 GBit/s Ethernet you
	  will need to select this option to use GMAC2 and GMAC3 with
	  external PHYs, SFP(+) cages in 10GBase-R, 5GBase-R or USXGMII
	  interface modes.

	  Note that as the 2500Base-X/1000Base-X/Cisco SGMII SerDes PCS
	  unit (MediaTek LynxI) in MT7988 is connected via the new 10GE
	  SerDes, you will also need to select this option in case you
	  want to use any of those SerDes modes.
